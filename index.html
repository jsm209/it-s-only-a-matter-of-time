            <p>
                This game was inspired by the lack of <b>happiness and value</b> 
                I sometimes find in life because of how I frame success. I included
                several nuances and metaphors to form a commentary my perspective.

            <h3>Bitsy Game Jam (37th Monthly Jam, Theme of "<b>trash</b>")</h3>
            <p>
                This game was developed for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/trash-bitsy" target="_blank">37th monthly bitsy game jam</a>.
                Bitsy is a little editor for little games. It offers a new source
                of creativity by severely limiting the designer in terms of complexity
                when it comes to creating graphics and basic game logic. Despite
                its limitations, it's a powerful tool in its own right for generating
                intriging and thought provoking experiences.
